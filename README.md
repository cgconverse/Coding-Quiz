## Coding-Quiz

## Description

The user will activate a 30 second timer once they press the 'start' button and the first question pops up.

The user will then race against the timer to correctly answer a series of multiple choice questions. If the correct answer is selected, it will be highlighted in green. If the wrong answer is chosen, it will be highlighted in red.

Each time the user chooses an incorrect answer, 5 seconds will be deducted from the timer.

Once the user selects thier answer, another question will be displayed.

When the timer runs out or when the user completes the quiz, the game is over. A score board will then be displayed where the user can save their initials and score to the score board.
